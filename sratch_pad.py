Here is where you can test some logic.

Feel free to add as many files as you need to this space. 

Also, you can add more tests to test_car.py to make sure your logic works! 

You can run the test using:

python -m pytest 

This runs every file that has "test" in the front, and every function in that file with "test" in front too. 

If python -m pytest does not work, make sure your terminal is in this directory, and run pip install pytest

print("Test logic here!")
